\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{section:experiment}
To evaluate our prototype~\toolname, we conducted a detailed experimental evaluation on the available MUS benchmarks.
The objective of the experimental evaluation is to evaluate the performance of \toolname~with the existing MUS enumerators.

\subsection{Benchmark and Baseline}
We collected our benchmark from two areas:~(i)~MUS track of the SAT $2011$ competition~(ii)~scalable benchmark\footnote{\url{https://gitlab.com/satisfiability/scalablesat}} 
from MUS counting~\cite{BM2020}. We compare our prototype with three MUS enumeration tools: 
~(i)~\marco~\cite{LPMM2016}~(ii)~\unimus~\cite{BC2020}~and~(iii)~\remus~\cite{BCB2018}.

\subsection{Environmental Settings}
All experiments were conducted on a high-performance computing cluster equipped with nodes featuring AMD EPYC $7713$ CPUs, each with $128$ real cores. 
%We imposed a runtime limit of 5000 seconds and a memory cap of 16GB for each experiment.
%All experiments were carried out on a high-performance computer cluster, where each node consists of AMD EPYC $7713$ CPUs running with $128$ real cores. 
Throughout the experiment, the runtime and memory limits were set to $3600$ seconds and $16$GB, respectively, for all considered tools.

\subsection{Experimental Result}
We present the performance of all MUS enumerators in~\Cref{table:mus_enumeration_result}.
To compare the performance, the table shows the number of solveds instances of all MUS enumerators and their corresponding PAR-$2$ scores.
An instance is considered to be solved by a tool if the tool is able to enumerate all of its MUSes. 
The table clearly demonstrates that \toolname~outperforms existing MUS enumerators.
